# SYNCED CONTENT - DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY

⚠️ **Parts of this directory are synced from /projects/SIL/docs/**

## Content Ownership

**Synced directories (DO NOT EDIT - regenerated by sync script)**:
- `canonical/` ← SYNCED from /projects/SIL/docs/canonical/
- `architecture/` ← SYNCED from /projects/SIL/docs/architecture/
- `research/` ← SYNCED from /projects/SIL/docs/research/
- `innovations/` ← SYNCED from /projects/SIL/docs/innovations/
- `tools/` ← SYNCED from /projects/SIL/docs/tools/
- `essays/` ← SYNCED from /projects/SIL/docs/essays/
- `meta/` ← SYNCED from /projects/SIL/docs/meta/
- `projects/` ← SYNCED from /projects/SIL/projects/
- `README.md` ← SYNCED from /projects/SIL/docs/README.md

**SIL-specific directories (✅ VERSION CONTROLLED)**:
- `articles/` ← Lab-specific articles
- `guides/` ← Lab-specific guides
- `notes/` ← Lab-specific notes
- `semantic-os/` ← Lab-specific semantic-os documentation
- `vision/` ← Lab-specific vision documents
- `.cache-bust` ← Cache control file
- `ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md` ← Lab organization plan
- `README_SYNCED_CONTENT.md` ← This file

## Version Control Strategy

✅ **FIXED (2025-12-13):** SIL-specific content is now properly version controlled!

**Previous problem:** Entire `docs/` directory was gitignored
**Current solution:** Pattern-based .gitignore that ignores synced content but tracks SIL-specific content

See `.gitignore` for the specific patterns used.

## To Update Synced Content

```bash
# 1. Edit source in SIL repo
cd /home/scottsen/src/projects/SIL
vim docs/canonical/SOME_FILE.md
git commit -am "docs: update"
git push

# 2. Sync to SIL website
cd /home/scottsen/src/projects/sil-website
./scripts/sync-docs.sh

# 3. Regenerate llms-full.txt (if needed)
./scripts/generate-llms-full.sh

# 4. Deploy
./deploy/deploy-container.sh staging --fresh
```

## To Update SIL-Specific Content

```bash
# Edit directly (NOW VERSION CONTROLLED!)
cd /home/scottsen/src/projects/sil-website
vim docs/articles/new-article.md

# Commit changes
git add docs/articles/new-article.md
git commit -m "docs: add new article"

# Deploy
./deploy/deploy-container.sh staging --fresh
```
