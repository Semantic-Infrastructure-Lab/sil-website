# Get In Touch

## Collaboration

We're building semantic infrastructure in the open and welcome collaboration from researchers, engineers, and anyone who believes intelligent systems should be transparent and inspectable.

### Technical Collaboration

**GitHub:** [github.com/Semantic-Infrastructure-Lab](https://github.com/Semantic-Infrastructure-Lab)

- Report issues or contribute to our tools
- Explore the architecture and propose improvements
- Fork and build on our work

**Email:** [scott@semanticinfrastructurelab.org](mailto:scott@semanticinfrastructurelab.org)

For research collaboration, integration questions, or technical discussion.

## Use Our Tools

The fastest way to engage with SIL is to use what we've built:

```bash
pip install reveal-cli
reveal --help
```

Try progressive disclosure on your own codebase. See structure before content. Experience 10-150x token reduction.

**Other tools:**
- **Morphogen** — Deterministic computation framework
- **TiaCAD** — Declarative parametric CAD
- **GenesisGraph** — Cryptographic provenance

## Areas of Interest

We're particularly interested in collaboration around:

- **Progressive disclosure** — Structure-first exploration patterns
- **Semantic provenance** — Tracking transformations and decisions
- **Cross-domain composition** — Making heterogeneous systems work together
- **Agent infrastructure** — Multi-agent orchestration with transparency
- **Deterministic computation** — Reproducibility and verification

## For Researchers

If you're working on:
- Semantic memory and provenance systems
- Universal semantic intermediate representations
- Multi-agent coordination substrates
- Human-AI interaction patterns

...and see potential for collaboration, reach out.

## For Engineers

All our production systems are open source:
- Bug reports and feature requests welcome
- Pull requests reviewed thoughtfully
- Documentation improvements valued
- Test coverage expansion appreciated

**Start here:** Pick a system, try it out, read the code, file an issue or PR.

## Funding & Support

SIL is the research division of the [Semantic Infrastructure Foundation](https://semanticinfrastructurefoundation.org) (SIF), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in formation.

## Response Time

Scott reads every message. Response time varies based on current work, but expect a reply within a few days for substantive inquiries.
