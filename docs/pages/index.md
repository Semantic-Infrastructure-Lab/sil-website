# Semantic Infrastructure Lab

> **What is SIL?** A research lab building the Semantic Operating System—infrastructure where AI representations are explicit, transformations are traceable, and reasoning can be inspected and composed with human judgment.

---

## The Problem We're Solving

AI systems today are powerful but structurally incomplete. They produce impressive results, yet their internal reasoning remains opaque, fragile, and fundamentally uninspectable.

If AI today is **wood**—useful but structurally unreliable—then SIL is building **steel**: the structural materials, building codes, and inspection protocols for production-grade intelligent systems.

## What We Build

SIL develops **semantic infrastructure**—a substrate where:

- **Representations are explicit** — meaning is structured, not guessed
- **Transformations are traceable** — every step has provenance
- **Reasoning is inspectable** — you can see how conclusions were reached
- **Composition works** — systems combine correctly across domains

This is the [Semantic Operating System](/canonical/architecture): persistent memory, unified representations, deterministic engines, multi-agent orchestration, and interfaces where every cognitive layer remains visible.

## Production Systems

These aren't demos. They're working infrastructure proving the architecture:

### [Reveal](/tools/reveal) — Progressive Code Exploration
`pip install reveal-cli` · v0.23.0 · 2K+ downloads/month

Structure-first code exploration with 10-150x token reduction. See file structure before reading content. Extract specific functions without loading entire files.

```bash
reveal src/            # Directory structure
reveal app.py          # File structure (functions, classes)
reveal app.py main     # Extract specific function
```

### [Morphogen](/innovations/morphogen) — Cross-Domain Computation
v0.11 · 1,600+ tests · 85% coverage

Unified computational substrate spanning 40+ domains. MLIR-based deterministic execution with cryptographic provenance.

### [GenesisGraph](/innovations/genesisgraph) — Verifiable Provenance
v0.3.0 · Cryptographic audit trails

Every transformation produces a provenance record. Selective disclosure lets you verify without revealing everything.

### [TiaCAD](/tools/tiacad) — Declarative Parametric CAD
v3.1.2 · 1,027 tests · 92% coverage

Parametric CAD in YAML. Semantic constraints, not just geometry. Proof that semantic infrastructure works for physical design.

## Current Research

- **[Progressive Disclosure for AI Agents](/essays/progressive-disclosure-for-ai-agents)** — Why structure-first exploration reduces tokens 25x
- **[RAG as Semantic Manifold Transport](/research/rag-manifold)** — Rethinking retrieval as geometric transport
- **[Agent Help Standard](/research/agent-help)** — Strategic guidance for AI agents using CLI tools

## The Lab

SIL is the research division of the [Semantic Infrastructure Foundation](https://semanticinfrastructurefoundation.org), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (forming). We build in the open, publish our work, and invite collaboration.

**Current team:**
- **Scott Senkeresty** — Founder & Chief Architect
- **TIA** — Chief Semantic Agent (transparent AI collaboration)

**Philosophy:**
- Glass-box transparency — all work visible and traceable
- Structure before heuristics — explicit meaning, not statistical inference
- Stewardship over extraction — public infrastructure, not proprietary capture

## Get Involved

- **Use the tools:** `pip install reveal-cli` and try progressive disclosure
- **Read the research:** [Essays](/essays) and [Research Papers](/research)
- **Explore the architecture:** [Canonical Documents](/canonical)
- **Collaborate:** [Contact us](/contact) or visit [GitHub](https://github.com/Semantic-Infrastructure-Lab)
