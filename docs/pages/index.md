# Semantic Infrastructure Lab

> **What is SIL?** A research lab building the Semantic Operating System—infrastructure where AI representations are explicit, transformations are traceable, and reasoning can be inspected and composed with human judgment.

**4 production systems · 12 research papers · 3K+ active users · 100% open source**

---

## The Problem We're Solving

AI systems today are powerful but structurally incomplete. They produce impressive results, yet their internal reasoning remains opaque, fragile, and fundamentally uninspectable.

If AI today is **wood**—useful but structurally unreliable—then SIL is building **steel**: the structural materials, building codes, and inspection protocols for production-grade intelligent systems.

## What We Build

SIL develops **semantic infrastructure**—a substrate where:

- **Representations are explicit** — meaning is structured, not guessed
- **Transformations are traceable** — every step has provenance
- **Reasoning is inspectable** — you can see how conclusions were reached
- **Composition works** — systems combine correctly across domains

This is the [Semantic Operating System](/foundations/semantic-os-architecture): persistent memory, unified representations, deterministic engines, multi-agent orchestration, and interfaces where every cognitive layer remains visible.

## Working Systems

These aren't demos. They're working infrastructure proving the architecture:

### 🌟 Featured: [Reveal](/systems/reveal) — Progressive Code Exploration

**The entry point to semantic infrastructure. In production. Proven at scale.**

`pip install reveal-cli` · **v0.24.0** · **3K+ downloads/month** · 100% organic growth

Structure-first code exploration with **25x token reduction**. See file structure before reading content. Extract specific functions without loading entire files. Used by developers and AI agents worldwide.

```bash
# Try it now - takes 30 seconds
pip install reveal-cli
reveal src/            # Directory structure
reveal app.py          # File structure (functions, classes)
reveal app.py main     # Extract specific function
```

### [Morphogen](/systems/morphogen) — Cross-Domain Computation
v0.11 · 1,600+ tests · 85% coverage

Unified computational substrate spanning 40+ domains. MLIR-based deterministic execution with cryptographic provenance.

### [GenesisGraph](/systems/genesisgraph) — Verifiable Provenance
v0.3.0 · Cryptographic audit trails

Every transformation produces a provenance record. Selective disclosure lets you verify without revealing everything.

### [TiaCAD](https://github.com/Semantic-Infrastructure-Lab/tiacad) — Declarative Parametric CAD
v3.1.2 · 1,027 tests · 92% coverage

Parametric CAD in YAML. Semantic constraints, not just geometry. Proof that semantic infrastructure works for physical design.

## The Lab

SIL is the research division of the [Semantic Infrastructure Foundation](https://semanticinfrastructurefoundation.org), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (forming). We build in the open, publish our work, and invite collaboration.

**Current team:**
- **Scott Senkeresty** — Founder & Chief Architect
- **TIA** — Chief Semantic Agent (transparent AI collaboration)

**Philosophy:**
- Glass-box transparency — all work visible and traceable
- Structure before heuristics — explicit meaning, not statistical inference
- Stewardship over extraction — public infrastructure, not proprietary capture
