# Semantic OS Documentation

**Status:** Content in development

This directory will contain comprehensive documentation for the Semantic Operating System architecture and implementation.

## Current Documentation

The Semantic OS is currently documented in multiple locations:

### Core Architecture
- [Semantic OS Architecture (Manifesto)](/foundations/semantic-os-architecture) - Vision and philosophical foundation
- [Semantic OS Reference](/foundations/SIL_SEMANTIC_OS_ARCHITECTURE) - Technical reference (v2.0)
- [Technical Charter](/foundations/SIL_TECHNICAL_CHARTER) - Formal specification

### Layer-Specific Documentation
- **Layer 0 (Semantic Memory)** - See Technical Charter §5
- **Layer 1 (Primitives)** - [Morphogen](/systems/morphogen)
- **Layer 2 (Structures)** - [TiaCAD](/systems/tiacad), [GenesisGraph](/systems/genesisgraph)
- **Layer 3 (Composition)** - [Pantheon](/systems/pantheon)
- **Layer 4 (Dynamics)** - Morphogen scheduler (Technical Charter §9)
- **Layer 5 (Intent)** - Validation systems (Technical Charter §11)
- **Layer 6 (Intelligence)** - [Agent Ether](/systems/agent-ether)

### Related Research
- [RAG as Semantic Manifold Transport](/research/RAG_AS_SEMANTIC_MANIFOLD_TRANSPORT)
- [Hierarchical Agency Framework](/research/agent-infrastructure/HIERARCHICAL_AGENCY_FRAMEWORK)
- [Progressive Disclosure Guide](/research/information-architecture/PROGRESSIVE_DISCLOSURE_GUIDE)

## Planned Content

This directory will consolidate Semantic OS documentation with:
- Unified API reference
- Implementation guides
- Cross-layer integration patterns
- Performance characteristics and benchmarks

## Timeline

Consolidated documentation will be published as the architecture stabilizes and more layers reach production readiness.
