    <h1>All Projects</h1>
    <p class="intro">
        12 projects spanning the full Semantic OS architecture—from production systems to active research to exploratory prototypes.
        Some are polished and ready for use. Others are rough experiments, proofs-of-concept, throwing code at the wall to see what sticks.
        <strong>Maturity varies widely.</strong> We mark what's production-ready (✅), what's research-grade (🔬), what's alpha/experimental (🚧),
        what's still just a spec (📋), and what's purely conceptual (💭).
